/**
 * How a share of wasted resource reads as a colour.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* part of `lib/score`'s graded model, and the distinction matters. Nothing in the
 * simulator or the priority list says how much overflow is acceptable — the list spends a resource
 * when it has something worth spending it on and pools it when it does not — which is exactly why
 * neither energy nor chi carries a graded section. Inventing a threshold and calling it a verdict is
 * the failure this report is built to avoid.
 *
 * What this is instead: a reading aid on one tile, so a number a reader cannot calibrate carries some
 * hint of its own size. The bands are round numbers rather than quantiles of a sample, and they are
 * round on purpose — three reference pulls (1.4%, 2.4%, 3.4% of chi generated) is far too small to
 * derive a distribution from, and dressing three points up as percentiles would claim a precision
 * that does not exist.
 *
 * The copy beside it never says "good" or "bad". It states the number.

 * applies and applies harder — nothing says how many Chi Brew charges a pull is *supposed* to spend,
 * only that a charge sitting at the ceiling is not recharging. These bands are a hint at the size of

/**
 * `usageTone` again, and much more forgiving, for a cooldown whose worth the *encounter* sets.
 *
 * Touch of Karma is the case. Its charges are counted the same way Chi Brew's are — the opener plus
 * one per recharge inside the pull — but the two are not the same claim. A Chi Brew charge is worth
 * pressing whenever it is up; a Karma charge is worth pressing only while something is hitting you,
 * and a pull that offers three recharges rarely offers three stretches of incoming damage. Grading
 * that against `usageTone`'s 90/70 calls two presses out of three a failure, which faults a player
 * for the shape of the fight rather than for anything they did.
 *
 * So: nearly every charge is `good`, at least half is `ok`, and below half is worth a reader's eye
 * rather than a verdict. Round numbers, and the same caveat as everything else in this file — a hint
 * at the size of a number, never a judgement, and never anything `lib/score` counts. The graded
 * question about Touch of Karma is what the presses *returned*, which is a different tile.
